# Research-reports-Course-project-reports

This is a collection of **papers and reports** that I have completed in **course projects or competitions** since my university years. These papers involve multiple fields, such as computer science theory, algorithms, hardware, automatic control, and artificial intelligence. All these papers were written in **markdown or LaTeX**. Since the code parts of these projects are somewhat disorganized, I have gathered all the papers together here.
